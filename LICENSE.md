# LICENSE

Since RPC-MT code is derived from the Glibc RPC code, written by Oracle,
RPC-MT inherits the license from that code.  That is probably the kind of
license I would want to distribute my code under, anyway.  The preamble
comment section at the top of each source code file is the Oracle license
comment, intact, followed by my additional comments.
